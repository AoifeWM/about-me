            My name is Aoife Mulligan and I'm a 21 year old upcoming software developer from Seattle, Washington. 
            <ul>
                <li>I have a high school diploma.</li>
                <li>I attended California Polytechnechic for chemistry but after two semesters I realized I don't want to go into chemistry professionally and left to pursue coding.</li>
                <li>I worked as a summer camp councellor at a beach camp for several summers.</li>
            </ul>
            I'm an avid artist and spend a lot of my free time painting in oil on canvas. I'm also passionate about technology, software development, biology, science, cooking, gardening, and brewing and distilling alcohol. I have two tortoises, a snake, and a dog, all of whom are very lovely. <br> <br>
