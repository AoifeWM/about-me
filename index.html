            My name is Aoife Mulligan and I'm a 21 year old upcoming software developer from Seattle, Washington. I have a high school diploma, and I attended California Polytechnechic for chemistry but after two semesters I realized I don't want to go into chemistry professionally and left. I'm an avid artist and spend a lot of my free time painting in oil on canvas. I'm also passionate about technology, software development, biology, science, cooking, gardening, and brewing and distilling alcohol. I have two tortoises, a snake, and a dog, who are all very lovely. <br> <br>
